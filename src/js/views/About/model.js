export const textData = `Hello, my name is, as you can probably see, Nícolas Reichert, and I'm a Brazilian/Italian programmer. I really love to program, and my focus area is game and front-end development.
  \n
  Games have been my passion since the mid 90’s, when I got my first SNES. Since then, I knew I would want to be part of a project as audacious as the games I was playing.
  \n
  I'm currently based in Prague and looking for exciting opportunities here, be it for jobs or for collaboration.

  Case you have any interest in contacting me, you can do so from <a href="#contact">contact page</a>, where you can also find some of my links to social networks.`;
