# Portfolio React

## Getting started

Configuring this repository to get going is extremely simple.

Assuming you already have installed Node and npm (if you don't, [check how to here](https://nodejs.org/en/)), all you'll need to do is:

* Open the terminal in the root folder of the project

* Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

* Once all the dependencies are installed, just run, from the root folder:
```
npm start
```

Now you're good to go!
